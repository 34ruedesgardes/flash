# flash
Command line script to flash SD card images for the Raspberry Pi.

This script can

* download a compressed SD card from the internet or from S3
* use a local SD card image, either compressed or uncompressed
* wait until a SD card is plugged in
* search for a SD card plugged into your Computer
* show progress bar while flashing (if `pv` is installed)
* copy a optional `occidentalis.txt` file into the boot partition of the SD image
* optional set the hostname of this SD image
* optional set the WiFi settings as well
* play a little sound after flashing
* unplugs the SD card

At the moment only Mac OS X and Linux is supported.

## Installation

Download the appropriate version for Linux or Mac with this command

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hypriot/flash/master/`uname -s`/flash
chmod +x flash
sudo mv flash /usr/local/bin/flash
```

### Install Dependencies

The `flash` script needs optional tools

* `curl` - if you want to flash directly with an HTTP URL
* `aws` - if you want to flash directly from an AWS S3 bucket
* `pv` - to see a progress bar while flashing with the `dd` command

#### Mac

```bash
brew install pv
brew install awscli
```

#### Linux

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y pv
sudo apt-get install -y python-pip
sudo pip install awscli
```

## occidentalis.txt

The option `--config` could be used to copy a `occidentalis.txt` into the SD image before it is unplugged.

Many kudos to [Adafruit's occi](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Occi) package that handles updating hostname and WiFi settings while booting the Raspberry Pi.

The config file `occidentalis.txt` should look like

```
# hostname for your Hypriot Raspberry Pi:
hostname=hypriot-pi

# basic wireless networking options:
wifi_ssid=SSID
wifi_password=12345
```

## Use cases

### Flash a compressed SD image from the internet

```bash
flash http://assets.hypriot.com/hypriot-rpi-20150329-140334.img.zip
```

### Flash with a given hostname

This works only for SD card images that already have `occi` installed.

```bash
flash --hostname mypi hypriot.img
```

Then unplug the SD card from your computer, plug it into your Pi and boot your Pi. After a while the Pi can be found via Bonjour/avahi and you can log in with

```bash
ssh pi@mypi.local
```
